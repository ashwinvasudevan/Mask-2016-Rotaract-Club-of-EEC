**The Mask**, a marvellous annual theatre play organized by the rotaractors of SRM Easwari , has tried to revive the “art of theatres”. The Mask has lent a helping hand to this admirable cause and has also got the people, especially the youngsters, to enjoy and appreciate wholesome joy of watching and experiencing artistry of the highest order, thereby breathing new life into the perishing art form. Nothing can match up to the effect of watching real people performing on a live stage in front of our very eyes! So get all set to catch the spectacular action at the MASK 16!
